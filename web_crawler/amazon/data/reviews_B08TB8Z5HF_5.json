    "reviewText": "I purchased these bulbs for three reasons. First, they were on sale during Amazon Prime Days. Second, being TP-Link Kasa products they work with my existing Kasa App and are also compatible with the Deco router app so I didn't need another app (TP-Link? We don't need Kasa, Deco and Taco- consolidate them already.) And Third, and most importantly, SengLED finally completely and utterly self destructed and stopped working with the Alexa infrastructure. These four bulbs on sale cost less than a two pack of the SengLED brand which require a Zigbee hub that doesn't work without the SengLED back office- which is basically dead now.For the bulbs themselves, they are slightly smaller than old fashioned bulbs, so don't try using them in a lamp that has a spring-grip shade. Setting them up is simple, have the Kasa or Deco app open, select add a bulb of this model and turn the bulb on. You will connect to it via Wi-Fi and then setup will take a couple of minutes depending on how slow/busy your local network is. On my Deco (TP-Link) network, the bulb took about 30 seconds to connect and appear.I haven't had a problem with the bulbs in the month they've been operational, so they already are doing better than the old SengLED bulbs ever did. And even when my internet connection is down; these bulbs still seem to work okay since they are controlled by the Deco routers (note: I've since moved my other Kasa devices over to the Deco app because controlling them from Kasa they do stop working if the internet connection is down.)I've been pretty please with most of the TP-Link hardware I've purchased over the years, and am glad the bulbs are apparently reliable as well.",

I wish Iâ€™d gotten these to begin with, setup was soooooo easy and i had 4 setup in the time it took to setup one of the other brand.  They were picked up by Alexa app in no time and my light automation was back.  The brightness is just right, i can adjust the brightness, colours, when they come on, turn off with ease.  They work extremely well and i now have 8 of these bulbs due to their ease of use, setup.  Definitely recommend",

    "reviewText": "After getting stuck with a bunch of smart bulbs that are no longer supported by Alexa (sengled I'm looking at you), I was looking to try a new brand. I also tried Sylvania wifi bulbs and Govee, but still wasn't super happy and decided to try this set.These are THE BEST. I installed the app, plugged in a bulb and it paired almost instantly. I linked it to Alexa and boom- voice control for my lights again. SUPER easy set up and pairing. No hub needed. No glitchy bulb app you have to use every time to turn the bulb on. And reasonably priced too. These will be my new solution.",

    "reviewText": "After trying out a few different smart bulb brands over the years, Kasa has become our go-to. These bulbs are reliable, affordable, and packed with features. The setup was quick through the Kasa app, and the integration with Alexa works flawlesslyâ€”we can change colors, dim lights, or set schedules all through voice or the app.The color-changing options are vibrant, and the dimming is smooth without any flickering, which makes a huge difference in different rooms throughout the day. Whether we're relaxing with soft lighting in the evening or using bright daylight settings in the kitchen, the bulbs adjust beautifully.One of the biggest wins for us is consistencyâ€”weâ€™ve replaced most lights in the house with Kasa bulbs, and they all stay connected, respond instantly, and allow for easy grouping and automation. The app is simple to use but still powerful enough to set routines and timers, making it feel like the lights just take care of themselves.Honestly, I donâ€™t have anything negative to say. Theyâ€™ve worked perfectly for us. If you're looking for a dependable, feature-rich smart bulb without the premium price tag, Kasa is hard to beat.",

    "reviewText": "One time I put a bulb over my head, in the classic gag that signifies that I have an idea. Â The bulb didnâ€™t activate, but thatâ€™s not its fault - I probably didnâ€™t have an idea. Â I wasnâ€™t embarrassed by the non-response, as I was alone in the basement. Â Later on, the bulb worked beautifully - when I used it as instructed. It was easy to set up and control with Alexa,Â Â with bonus features easily accessible via the app. Â Color, etc. Â Hooray, it is nice.",

Connecting them is super easy and relatively fast as long as you can hold your phone next to the bulb, and the features are amazing on the app. I've had very few and subtle issues with the app but nothing that can't be fixed pretty quickly. Definitely buying more when they go on sale again. I've been using kasa bulbs for 4 years now and the only reason I'm buying more is because my roommate took most of them, I've never had one break or quit working yet",

The app is easy to setup and use (I already had a few outlet switches I used so I was already very familiar but it's very intuitive).  I love that I can set a schedule and the colour and brightness so I don't have to think, I open my door to let the dogs out and the light is already on!  Going to bed, did I remember to turn the light off?  It doesn't matter because the schedule will flip it off on its own!We'll see how these hold up for the long run, but for the first 2 weeks they are totally worth the purchase if you're looking for an easy and convenient solution to automated lighting without having to get a homebase.",
