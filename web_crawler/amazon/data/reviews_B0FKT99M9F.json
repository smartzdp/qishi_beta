    "reviewText": "Installed it in 15 minutes—no pro needed, fits standard US/Canada doors. Connects to Alexa/Google easily, making it the heart of my smart home. 36 ringtones beat the boring \"ding-dong.\" One-touch unlock inside is great for my grandma. Free 3-day cloud storage lets me check past footage anytime. Simple, useful, and worth it.",

    "reviewText": "Finally, a lock that keeps up with my messy life. Auto-lock after 10 seconds? Perfect for forgetful folks like me. Unlocking options: voice (Alexa/Google), app, fingerprint, or old-school key—covers everyone. The 10,000mAh battery lasts 6-8 months, no constant recharging. Spoof-proof passwords and panic codes? Adds peace of mind. Once you use it, you can’t go back.",
